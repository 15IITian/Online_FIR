## Overview

The **Decentralised Online FIR Platform** aims to revolutionize the FIR (First Information Report) process by utilizing blockchain technology. The project consists of three smart contracts:

1. **FIR_Components:** Collects information about FIR reports and individuals involved, ensuring transparency and integrity in the reporting process.

2. **Police_Station:** Manages details about police stations, tracks registered FIRs, and provides functions for terminating FIRs and recording progress or work done in response to FIRs.

3. **FIR:** Handles the registration of FIRs, generates unique FIR IDs, and stores information about accused individuals. It employs events for transparent logging and requires statements for enforcing specific conditions.


## Integration with Frontend
   - Work is in progress to integrate the backend functionality with a user-friendly frontend. Stay tuned for updates!

## Deployed on MODE Network
   - The Decentralised Online FIR Platform is deployed on MODE Network ‚Äì an L2 solution for Ethereum. Benefit from fast and cost-effective transactions, taking advantage of the SFS (Somebody else's Fee System) mechanism by registering the smart contracts with the SFS contract.
